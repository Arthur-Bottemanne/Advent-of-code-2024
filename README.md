# Advent-of-code-2024

I gave up on my original idea of using a random language per day. I wasn't really motivated to do the AoC like this. I'll do the rest in rust since I am original :)

---

-   First day, php was chosen...
-   For the second day, C was the chosen one...
-   Third day is for rust! finally an actual programming language.
-   Fourth day is Java, barely touched it so we'll see how it goes.
-   Fifth day is C again, let's try it again RAAAAAAH
-   Eighth day is php
